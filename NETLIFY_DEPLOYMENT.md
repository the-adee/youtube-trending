# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide for YouTube Trending Analytics

## 🔧 **Problem Solved**

This setup resolves the issue where environment variables were hardcoded into the build. Now your API keys remain secure and can be set directly in Netlify's dashboard.

## 📋 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Netlify Environment Variables Setup**

In your Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
   VITE_API_KEY = your_production_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. **Deploy to Netlify**

#### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo in Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically use the `netlify.toml` configuration

#### Option B: Manual Deploy
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Drag the `dist` folder to Netlify

### 3. **Verify Deployment**

After deployment, check:
1. Open browser dev tools → Console
2. Look for: `🌍 Runtime environment loaded: {VITE_API_BASE_URL: "...", VITE_API_KEY: "..."}`
3. Verify API calls work correctly

## 🏗️ **How It Works**

### Build Process:
1. **Netlify runs** `netlify-build.sh` script
2. **Script creates** `public/env-config.js` with your environment variables
3. **HTML loads** the script before your React app
4. **Config system** picks up variables at runtime

### Environment Priority:
1. **Runtime variables** (Netlify dashboard) - Highest priority
2. **Build-time variables** (.env file) - Medium priority  
3. **Development fallback** (localhost) - Lowest priority

## 📁 **Files Added/Modified**

### New Files:
- `src/config/env.js` - Environment configuration system
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
- `netlify-build.sh` - Environment injection script
- `public/env-config.js` - Development fallback
- `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - This guide

### Modified Files:
- `src/services/api.js` - Updated to use new config system
- `index.html` - Added env-config.js script

## 🔒 **Security Benefits**

✅ **API keys not hardcoded** in built files  
✅ **Environment-specific** configurations  
✅ **Secure headers** configured in netlify.toml  
✅ **Development fallbacks** for local testing  

## 🛠️ **Local Development**

Your local development still works:
1. Keep your `.env` file for local development
2. The system automatically detects and uses appropriate config
3. Console logs help debug configuration issues

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If API calls fail after deployment:

1. **Check Netlify Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # In Netlify dashboard, verify:
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
   VITE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for environment loading messages
   - Verify API endpoints are correct

3. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Verify API calls go to correct URL
   - Check if API key is being sent in headers

### If build fails:

1. **Make script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x netlify-build.sh
   ```

2. **Check build logs** in Netlify dashboard

## 🌟 **Benefits**

- 🔐 **Secure**: API keys not exposed in built files
- 🚀 **Fast**: No runtime API calls to fetch config
- 🛠️ **Flexible**: Works across different environments
- 📱 **Universal**: Works on all hosting platforms
- 🔄 **Maintainable**: Easy to update without rebuilding

Your app is now ready for secure production deployment! 🎉
